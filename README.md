# Merge-Two-Sorted-Lists
Solution for "Merge Two Sorted Lists"

This code recursively merges two linked lists l1 and l2 by comparing the values of their nodes. It connects the nodes from either l1 or l2 to the merged list based on the comparison result. The merging process continues recursively until all nodes from both lists are merged, and the final merged list is returned.
